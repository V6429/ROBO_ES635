/********************************************************************************
 Platform: SPARK V
 Experiment: 3_Timer1_Overflow_Interrupt
 Written by: Vinod Desai, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 Edited By: Sachitanand Malewar, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 Last Modification: 22nd September 2010
 AVR Studio Version 4.17, Build 666
 
 Concepts covered: Use of timer overflow interrupt to do tasks in a peirodic way

 This experiment demonstrates use of timer overflow interrupt

 In this example timer 1's overflow interrupt is used to turn on and off Buzzer 
 with the time peirod of 1 second. The Buzzer is connected at PORTC3
 
 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega16
 	Frequency: 7372800
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper 
	              optimization options below figure 4.22 in the hardware manual)

 2. TIMSK = 0x04; //timer1 overflow interrupt enable must be done in init devices. 
    It should not be done in timer1_init()
